# Client-Server Chat System

This is a simple client-server chat system implemented in Python. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages.

## Features

- Clients can connect to the server and send messages.
- The server echoes the received messages back to the clients.
- Multiple clients can communicate with the server simultaneously.
- The server runs on the localhost, but you can modify the host IP address to run on different machines.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No additional packages or libraries are required as it uses the built-in `socket` module.

## Usage

1. Run the `server.py` file to start the server.
   ```shell
   python server.py
